## Why does it exist?

There many other "reader modes", but they all extract article text and re-render it their own format. Unclutter "unclutters" the original web pages itself, leaving the [original website styling](docs/comparison.md) and interactive elements intact. 

Adjustments for specific websites are crowdsourced — if you find an annoyance while reading, remove it for everyone!

<!-- Articles you read are saved and organized automatically, instead of having to maintain bookmark folders, tags, or share links between multiple websites.
With Unclutter, everything happens instantly in your browser.

## Get involved

The goal of this project is to improve reading on the web for everyone. You should decide what, when, and how to read articles. What if Unclutter could automatically bypass paywalls, connect similar content across the web, or make quotes easily sharable?
